    "## Introduction to Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data. Hypothesis Testing is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis testing is an essential procedure in statistics. A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data. When we say that a finding is statistically significant, it’s thanks to a hypothesis test.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level of significance:\n",
    "Refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null-hypothesis. 100% accuracy is not possible for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis, so we therefore select a level of significance that is usually 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is normally denoted with alpha(maths symbol ) and generally it is 0.05 or 5% , which means your output should be 95% confident to give similar kind of result in each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type I error**: When we reject the null hypothesis, although that hypothesis was true. Type I error is denoted by alpha. In hypothesis testing, the normal curve that shows the critical region is called the alpha region\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type II errors**: When we accept the null hypothesis but it is false. Type II errors are denoted by beta. In Hypothesis testing, the normal curve that shows the acceptance region is called the beta region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-tailed test :\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-tailed test is a statistical test in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values. If the sample being tested falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted instead of the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example : a college != 4000 student or data science != 80% org adopted**\n",
    "\n",
    "## P-value :\n",
    "\n",
    "The P value, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis (H 0) of a study question is true — the definition of ‘extreme’ depends on how the hypothesis is being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your P value is less than the chosen significance level then you reject the null hypothesis i.e. accept that your sample gives reasonable evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. It does NOT imply a “meaningful” or “important” difference; that is for you to decide when considering the real-world relevance of your result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Degree of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the number of degrees of freedom is the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary. The number of independent ways by which a dynamic system can move, without violating any constraint imposed on it, is called number of degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if a data set has 10 values, the sum of the 10 values must equal the mean x 10. If the mean of the 10 values is 3.5 (you could pick any number), this constraint requires that the sum of the 10 values must equal 10 x 3.5 = 35.\n",
    "With that constraint, the first value in the data set is free to vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever value it is, it’s still possible for the sum of all 10 numbers to have a value of 35. The second value is also free to vary, because whatever value you choose, it still allows for the possibility that the sum of all the values is 35.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The calculation of the correct number of degrees of freedom is important because the number of degrees of freedom determines the critical value at which you accept or reject a hypothesis. Thus the degrees of freedom help us to achieve desired confidence level, or the goal, in general in other tests.**\n"

    "## T Test\n",
    "\n",
    "A t-test is a type of inferential statistic which is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups which may be related in certain features. It is mostly used when the data sets, like the set of data recorded as outcome from flipping a coin a 100 times, would follow a normal distribution and may have unknown variances. T test is used as a hypothesis testing tool, which allows testing of an assumption applicable to a population.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Sample T Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Independent Samples t Test or 2-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are significantly different. The Independent Samples t Test is a parametric test. This test is also known as: Independent t Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paired Sampled T Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The paired sample t-test is also called dependent sample t-test. It’s an uni variate test that tests for a significant difference between 2 related variables. An example of this is if you where to collect the blood pressure for an individual before and after some treatment, condition, or time point.\n",
